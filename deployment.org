#+title: Deployment of a Lab as a unit

* Introduction

  A lab is a single unit which consists of multiple experiments.  Each
  experiment needs to be built and deployed individually.  This leads
  to wastage of time and effort which can be avoided by using a
  =deployment manager= that handles the build and deployment
  process of lab.

* Usage

  After building a lab, go to the lab directory and run the following
  command:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  
  make build-exp

  #+END_SRC

  This will clone all the experiments and build and deploy each
  experiment.
